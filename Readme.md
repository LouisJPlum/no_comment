# No Comment
still writing comments?  
sure it will make your code more understanable, but so do others.  
so this came out. (just a kidding ;~))  
  
remove all comments like "// comment \n"  
`no_comment.c` wont't work for /* comment */  
`no_comment_full.c` will deal with /* comment */  
  
## run
written in C so u need to compile it  
example using gcc compiler  
`gcc no_comment.c` or `gcc no_comment_full.c`
